      "message": "It looks like you\u2019ve been noticing mild, repeated soreness in your left biceps over a short period. That kind of localized, low-level soreness is often related to recent use or overuse of the muscle (exercise, lifting, or even holding something in one position too long). Since there\u2019s no other data here, this is just a general guess, not a diagnosis or medical advice.\n\nA few simple tips: give the arm a bit of rest and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous use for a day or two. Gently stretch the biceps and shoulder, and consider using a cool pack for the first 24 hours if it feels recently strained, then warm compresses after that. Over-the-counter pain relief might help if you normally tolerate it well. If the pain suddenly worsens, you notice swelling, bruising, weakness, numbness, or you can\u2019t bend or straighten the arm normally, it\u2019s important to get checked by a healthcare professional.",
