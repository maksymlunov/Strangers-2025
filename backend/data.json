      "advice": "Thanks for checking in. You mentioned pain or discomfort on the **right side of your chest**. I\u2019ll ask a couple of quick questions and then share some simple tips.\n\n**A few things that can help you notice patterns:**\n- Does it get worse when you **move, twist, or take a deep breath**?\n- Is it **sharp, dull, or tight**?\n- Did you **exercise, lift something heavy, cough a lot, or sleep in a weird position** recently?\n\n**Simple things you can try at home:**\n- **Rest that area:** Avoid heavy lifting, pushing, or intense exercise for a day or two.\n- **Gentle position changes:** Sit or lie in a position where the pain eases a bit; use a pillow to support your upper body.\n- **Warmth or cold:**  \n  - Try a **warm compress** (like a warm towel or heating pad on low) on the sore area for 10\u201315 minutes.  \n  - If it feels more like a strain, you can also try a **cold pack** wrapped in a cloth for 10\u201315 minutes.\n- **Slow breathing:** Take slow, gentle breaths to avoid tensing up. Don\u2019t force very deep breaths if they hurt.\n- **Avoid triggers:** If you notice certain movements or postures make it worse, try to limit those for now.\n\n**Very important:**  \nIf you notice any of these, you should seek urgent, in\u2011person help immediately:\n- Sudden or severe chest pain\n- Pain spreading to your **left arm, jaw, neck, back, or shoulder**\n- **Shortness of breath**, feeling like you can\u2019t get enough air\n- **Sweating, nausea, dizziness, or feeling faint**\n- Chest pain after a **fall, accident, or injury**\n\nThis is **NOT medical advice** and I\u2019m **not a doctor**. If the pain is strong, new, or worrying, or you\u2019re unsure what\u2019s causing it, it\u2019s safest to contact a healthcare professional or urgent care.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- How long you\u2019ve had the pain  \n- What it feels like (sharp, pressure, burning, etc.)  \n- What makes it better or worse  \n\nand I can suggest more tailored self-care ideas."

      "message": "It looks like you\u2019ve recently had sharp pains in both sides of your chest and now marked your head but didn\u2019t describe the feeling. Chest pain plus any new head symptom (headache, dizziness, pressure, confusion, vision changes) can sometimes point to something more serious, but it can also be from stress, muscle tension, poor sleep, or anxiety after worrying about the chest pain. I can\u2019t see your vitals or examine you, so this is only general information, not a diagnosis or medical advice.  \n\nGeneral tips: if you have sudden severe headache, \u201cworst in your life,\u201d confusion, trouble speaking, weakness, vision loss, or chest pain with shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea, call emergency services immediately. Otherwise, rest in a quiet, dark room, avoid screens for a bit, drink some water, and notice whether pain changes with movement, neck tension, or eye strain. If head or chest symptoms keep coming back or worry you, see a doctor in person soon.",
