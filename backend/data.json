Common causes include minor muscle strain or normal post-exercise soreness, especially if you\u2019ve done something a bit heavier or different from your usual activity. This isn\u2019t a diagnosis or medical advice, just general information.\n\nA few simple tips:  \n- Rest the arm from heavy lifting or repetitive motions for a day or two.  \n- Try gentle stretching of the biceps and shoulder, stopping if the pain sharpens.  \n- Use a cool pack for the first day if it feels irritated, then warm compresses to relax the muscle.  \n- Keep an eye on it: if pain gets worse, you notice swelling, weakness, bruising, or pain spreading to the chest or shoulder, contact a healthcare professional promptly.  \n- If you\u2019re unsure what caused it, think back over the last 24\u201348 hours for any unusual activity."
